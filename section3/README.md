# Section 3 - React Basics & Working With Components

## 25. What are Components? And Why Is React All About Them
- React is a <b>JavaScript library</b> for building user interfaces. You do not have to use React to build a website, but it makes it a heck of a lot easier. 
- Components are the building blocks of a user interface built in React. Components may be reused to avoid repeat code. 

## 26. React Code is Written in a "Declarative Way"!
- Components put HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together. Components mostly consist of HTML and JavaScript though, with the option of CSS.
- React uses a declarative approach. You define the target's end state and React figures out the DOM instructions.
- You can do everything in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but React makes it easier.
